# Arrays

Here are a list of tasks to better understand arrays.
These can be difficult and take a lot of time depending on coding level.
My advice would be to leave the task after trying it for a while (and feeling stuck) and come back after learning more about the concept or after doing other tasks.

Do not worry about the code running quickly/ most efficiently just that the answer is right.

Note: Arrays can also be called lists, in most cases the difference is not important can they can be thought of interchangeably.

## 1D Array practice

### Task 1

<https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/>

Topics to cover:

- Element index vs element value in Array

- Loops, for loops, and nested for loops

### Task 2

<https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/>

Topics to cover:

- While loops (optional)
- What is an "in place" operation
- out of bounds checking

### Task 3

<https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/>

Note: this might also take some time so don't be discouraged!

Topics to cover:

- Edge cases (some of the tests might break the code try to think of them before you run)
- Debuging, how to figure out if something is wrong in the code and what is wrong
- out of bounds checking
- Boolean & flags

## 2D Array practice

### Task 1

<https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/>

Topics to cover:

- Element index vs element value in Array
- Loops, for loops, and nested for loops
- Manipulating 2D arrays/lists
- Adding to an array (hint: look at "push" command for JavaScript)

This might be more difficult conceptually as 2d arrays are not as intuitive for some, but you can do it! :)
